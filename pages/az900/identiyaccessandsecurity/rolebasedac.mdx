# Describe Azure role-based access control

The principle of least privilege should be used. So that only the needed privileges are acquired by a user.

Doing this individually for each user is not feasible. So Azure role-based access control (also called Azure RBAC) is able to do that with roles.

Own roles can be created.

## How is it applied to resources?

RBAC is set to a scope, view the diagram from Microsoft below:
![Scopes diagram for RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-identity-access-security/media/role-based-access-scope-4b12a8f3.png)

Scopes include:

- Management group (collection of multiple subscriptions)
- Single subscription
- Resource group
- Single resource

<strong>BE AWARE</strong>: The permissions you set on the parent of a Role, will also be inherited by its children.

## How can it be enforced?

- It is always enforced on any action which goes through Azure Resource Manager.
- Resource Manager can be accessed through Az Protal, CLI and so on
- Application and data level access security is <strong>NOT</strong> controlled by RBAC
- RBAC uses allow model
  - Meaning, when I got a role with read access to a resource and another group I got write access to the same resource, I got both read and write in the end.
