# Zero trust model

It assumes the worst case scenario. It therefore protects the resources also like that.

MS recomments the following Zero trust models:

1. Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorized on all data points.
2. Least privileged access: I should only pass really required permissions.
3. Assume breach: Always assume that the network is already compromised.

## Adjusting to the Zero trust model

- <strong>Classic model</strong>: All devices are restricted to join the network. So for example, only cooperate devices are allowed. No personal devices are allowed and also I got tightly controlled VPN access.
- <strong>Zero trust model</strong>: It flips the logic. Here it does not assume a device is safe but it asks me to authenticate against it. So the location of the device is less of a matter but the authentication matters more
