# Describe Azure conditional access

Allows to deny or accept access to resources. This is based on who the use ris, where the user is and what device is used;

As MS says, it helps IT administrators to

- Empower users to work from anywhere
- Protect data and applications

I can also set it up, that when I am in the office, it should not ask for MFA, but when I am outside the office, it should ask for MFA.
