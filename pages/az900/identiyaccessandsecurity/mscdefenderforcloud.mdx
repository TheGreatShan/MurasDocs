# Microsoft Defender for Cloud

It montiors the security of not only azure cloud resources, but also on-prem, hybrid and multi-cloud.
It helps with the current security and also notifies about possible
security problems.

### Azure-native protections

MS Defender for Cloud protects the following:

- <strong>Azure PaaS services</strongs>: Detect threaths against Azure PaaS like App Service, Azure SQL, Azure Storage account and so on
- <strong>Azure data services</strong>: It will automatically classify the data for me in Azure SQL and also assess for possible vulnerabilities.
- <strong>Networks</strong>: Limits the exposure for brute force attacks. It also detects the network attacks.

### Defend hybrid resouces

Azure Arc extends the Defender for Cloud to on-prem and multi-cloud resources. It needs to be deployed and the Defender for Cloud's enhanced security feature
will need to be enabled.

### Secure multi-cloud resources

It also protects cloud resources from AWS for example.
I need to add it to my Azure subscription.

For AWS the following services are protected:

1. Defender for Clouds's CSPM features
2. Microsoft Defender for Containers
3. Microsoft Defender for Servers

### Assess, Secure and Defend

Three vital needs are managed by the Defender for Cloud:

1. <strong>Continuous assess</strong>: Know the security state of the resources
2. <strong>Secure</strong>: Protect the resources with Azure Security Benchmark
3. <strong>Defend</strong>: Detect and respond to threats

#### Continuously assess

It assess the environment and gives out security scores and recommendations.

#### Secure

Workloads need to be secure
In Defender for cloud, I can create policies and run them on management gorups, subscirptions and even tenants.
Scalibility is one of the most important parts in cloud. So if a resource scales up, the Defender for cloud automatically starts to protect and monitor it.

##### Defend

Security alerts are one of the most important parts of the Defender for Cloud.
The following security alerts are available:

- Describe affected resources
- Remediation steps
- Option to trigger a logic app

##### Advanced threat protection
