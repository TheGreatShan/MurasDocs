# Describe cloud computing

## Shared Responsibility model
With cloud providers, we as a company or as a person are responsible for the data saved on the infrastructure and the plattform, while the cloud Provier (e.g Microsoft Azure) is responsible for the infrastructure and network

Short summary of responsibility:
Us:
- Data stored in the cloud
- Alowed devices on the cloud (phone, pc)
- Accounts and identities who the access is granted too

Cloud provider:
- Datacenter
- Physical network
- Physical Host

## Cloud models
### Private cloud
That's a cloud, where the data is stored in servers which are dedicated for the company only. So it is nasically like an On-Premise infrastructure which is abroad or even be hosted by a third party.
This results in bigger costs

### Public cloud
The public can get a cloud ressource by purchasing it at a third party. (e. g Azure VM)

### Hybrid cloud
This is a combination of both, the public and the private cloud.

### Few Key Consideration as MS learn
| Public cloud                                     | Private cloud                                                    | Hybrid cloud                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No capital investemt vor scaling up              | Company has full control                                         | More flexibility                                                                                          |
| Apps can be quickly provisioned or deprovisioned | Data is not collected and not shared with other organizations    | Organization can choose to run it in private cloud or in public cloud as they wish regarding the use case |
| Pay as you go model                              | Hardware needs to be bought and maintaned by the company         | Company controls security, compliance and legal requirements                                              |
| Company has no complete control                  | Company is responsible for maintaining and updating the Hardware |                                                                                                           |

### Multi cloud
With this model, companies use more than one public cloud. This can be during a migration or also in PROD, you can use different cloud providers for different services.

Azure Arc and Azure VMware Solution can be helpful for this

## Consumption-based model
Consider two types of expenses:
1. Capital expenses (CapEx)
2. Operational expenses (OpEx)

### Capital expenses (CapEx)
It is a one tiem payment. 
Examples:
- Buy a company car
- Buy a server
- Buy a building

### Operational expenses (OpEx)
There are recuring payments. So spending money on services or products over a period of time. 
Examples:
- Rent a car
- Rent a server
- Rent a building

Cloud Computing (CC) obviosuly falls under OpEx, as the pay as you go model is used.

#### Benefits of Cloud Computing because the OpEx model
1. No upfront costs
2. No need to buy hardware
3. No need to maintain hardware
4. Able to pay for more resources as needed
5. Able to pay for less resources as needed
