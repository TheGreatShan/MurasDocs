# Describe the MS Cost Management tool

## What is MS Cost Management?

I can quickly check the Azure resource costs and also create alerts when resources expand a certain limit.

They are shown visibly.

### Cost alerts

There are three types of alerts:

1. Budget alerts (When the costs exceed a certain limit)
2. Cost alerts (When the costs exceed a certain limit)
3. Department spending quota alerts (When the costs exceed a certain limit)

#### Budget alerts

It alerts, when a certain limit which is set in the condition is exceeded.

#### Cost alerts

It alerts when my Azure credit monetary commitments are consumed.
It is for organizations with a Enterprise Agreements (EAs). They are generated at 90% and at 100% of the commitment.

#### Department spending quota alerts

When a depertment exceeds a certain limit, it will be alerted. this is fixed in the EA portal.

## Budgets

A spending limit in Azure.
