# Compare the Pricing and Total Cost of Ownership calculators

Azure got two different calculators:

1. Pricing calculator
2. TCO (Total cost of ownership) calculator

## Pricing calculator

With that, I can get the estimated costs for services. I can also select the region and the specific configuration I want to estimate the costs.

## TCO calculator

It is designed to understand, how much of a cost difference it will be to run a on-prem infrastructure vs Azure Cloud infrastructure. I can also add power and IT labor costs to the calculation.
