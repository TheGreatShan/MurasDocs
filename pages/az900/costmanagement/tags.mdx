# Describe the purpose of tags

Tags can contain metadata.
It is useful for:

1. Resource management: I can group resources together and manage them as a group.
2. Cost management: I can tag resources and then filter them in the cost
   management tool.
3. Operations management: I can tag resources according to theri criticality and then define the formalities in the SLA.
4. Security: Data classification can be created defining the sensitivity of the data. (Public availibility, internal use only, confidential, etc.)
5. Governance and regulatory compliance: Identify resources that are subject to specific regulations (ISO 27001).
   - For example, all resources need to be tagged with the owner, department, telephone number and expiration date.
6. Workload optimization and automation: Can help to visualize resources which are complex. For example, I can tag resources with the environment (dev, test, prod) and then automate the deployment of resources based on the tag.

## How to manage resource tags

Can be modified with the usual Azure tools (Portal, CLI, PowerShell, SDKs, etc.)
<strong>Azure Policy</strong> can be used to enforce tagging rules.
