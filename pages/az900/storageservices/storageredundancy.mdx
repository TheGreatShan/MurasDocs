# Azure storage redundancy

Azure storage always stores multiple backup of my data.
(Redundancy)

## Types of redundancy

### Redundancy options in primary region

Data is always stored three times in the primary region.
There I can choose between locally redundant storage (LRS) and zone-redundant storage (ZRS).

#### Locally redundant storage (LRS)

It saves three copies of the data in a single data center in the primary region.
It provides at least 11 nines of durability (99.999999999%) of objects over a given year.

It is the <strong>cheapest</strong> option. But also the <strong>least reliable</strong>.
It protects agains:

- Hardware failures
- Network failures
- Rack failures

But in case of flooding or fire in the data center it is not safe!

#### Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)

It replicates the data <strong>syncronously</strong> across three storage clusters in the primary region.
It provides at least 12 nines of durability (99.9999999999%) of objects over a given year.

The data is <strong>still</strong> accesible for read and write operations, also when a zone gets unavailable.

Microsoft recommends ZRS for:

- Applications that require high availability
- Restricting replication of data to meet governance requirements

### Redundancy options in secondary region

Used for applications requiring <strong>high durability</strong> and <strong>availability</strong>.

In that case it is also durable agains catastrophic failures in the primary region.

#### Geo-redundant storage (GRS)

It is similair to LRS, but it additionally also replicates <strong>asynchronously</strong> the data to a single physical location in a secondary region.
It provides at least 16 nines of durability (99.9999999999999999%) of objects over a given year.

#### Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)

It is similair to ZRS, but it additionally also replicates the data to a single physical location in a secondary region (LRS).

![model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/describe-azure-storage-services/media/geo-zone-redundant-storage-138ab5af.png)

Microsoft recommends GZRS for:

- Requiring maximum consistency
- Maximum durability
- Maximum availability
- Performance
- Resilience for disaster recovery

#### Read Access

With the read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) and read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) I can read the data from the secondary region, <strong>even if the primary is running optimal</strong>.
Geo-redundant storage ad Geo-zone-redundant storagecan not read or written to in the secondary region.

REMEMBER: Data in the secondary region might not be up-to-date (RPO, Recovery Point Objective)!
