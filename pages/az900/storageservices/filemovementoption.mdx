# Identify Azure file movement options

There are also tools to help migrating individual files or folders to Azure. These tools are:

1. AzCopy
2. Azure Storage Explorer
3. Azure File Sync

## AzCopy

A CLI for copying vlovs or files to or from my storage account

## Azure Storage Explorer

A GUI for AzCopy, which can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Azure File Sync

Centralizes my file shares in Azure Files but keeps the flexibility, performance and compitability of a Windows File server.
Its like turning the Windows File server into a mini contenxt delivery network (CDN -> Search if that is really a word/shortage form)

It is used to sync files between Windows Servers and Azure Files. It can be used to sync between different servers or between a server and Azure Files.
