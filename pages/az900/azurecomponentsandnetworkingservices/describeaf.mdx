# Azure functions
## What is serverless computing?
It is a cloud computing model in which the cloud takes care of the whole infrastrucute. Over updates, over problems, over scalibility and so on. There we only care and only focus on the code we want to publish.

## Benefits
1. No infrastructure management
2. Auto-scaling (scalibility) It will continue working over any work load
3. You only pay for what you use. So the time which is used, to run the code.

Azure functions are often used for REST requests. So when we perform work in response to an event.
With Azure functions I am only charged for the CPU run time.
